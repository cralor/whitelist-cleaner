I wanted to keep this code for the future, so I created this public repo.

Description
-----------
Removes inactive Minecraft players from the whitelist.

Requirements
------------
- Python 2.7+
- Your Minecraft log files

Instructions
------------
1. Grab the code. `git clone https://github.com/cralor/whitelist-cleaner.git`
2. Run code. `python whitelist_cleaner.py`
3. It will prompt you for your log file directory path, as well as a temporary directory.
The temporary directory doesn't matter, and all files will be removed after execution completes.
4. It will also ask you for a date. The time you enter will determine how many Minecraft players will be removed from the whitelist.
5. Watch it run and clean things up! All done.
